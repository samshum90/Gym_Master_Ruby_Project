### Gym

A local gym has asked you to build a piece of software to help them to manage memberships, and register members for classes.

#### MVP

- The app should allow the gym to create and edit Members
- The app should allow the gym to create and edit Classes
- The app should allow the gym to book members on specific classes
- The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
- The app should show all members that are booked in for a particular class

#### Possible Extensions

- Classes could have a maximum capacity, and users can only be added while there is space remaining.
- The gym could be able to give its members Premium or Standard membership. Standard members can only be signed up for classes during off-peak hours.
- The Gym could mark members and classes as active/deactivated. Deactivated members/classes will not appear when creating bookings.

#### Possible Personal Extensions

- Create instructors/trainers which can be assign as a personal trainer to a member and assigned as an instructor to teach classes

#### Even more Possible Personal Extensions(won't have time/knowledge for)

- Personal trainer can create a work out or diet plan for members
- Finance that take any fees for classes, memberships or personal trainer and add the monthly charge to a member
- Display the classes in a timetable structure in html - even more ambitious make multiple day classes
